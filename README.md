# Dropbox support for Thunderbird's Filelink feature

This add-on is no longer maintained by me. I will not be taking pull requests nor updating the add-on page.

I welcome somebody, anybody, to fork the source, fix it up and post a new version of the add-on to AMO.

[Developer documentation for Filelink can be found here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Thunderbird/Filelink_Providers)

## How to build this add-on

Run build.sh, (or sh build.sh). The .xpi will be created in the root directory.
